Q.1 Q.1 Keep accepting an input message from the user and displaying it till the user does not type 'Bye' (not case sensitive) using a Shell script.
#1/bin/bash

read -p "Enter the input :: " input

echo $input | grep -iw "bye" > /dev/null

while [ $? -ne 0 ]
do
   read -p "Enter the input :: " input

echo $input | grep -iw "bye" > /dev/null
done


vidyas@vidyas:~/os$ bash ass3a.sh
Enter the input :: ByE
vidyas@vidyas:~/os$ bash ass3a.sh
Enter the input :: ads 
Enter the input :: abc
Enter the input :: byE
vidyas@vidyas:~/os$ 

Q.2 Write a shell script to reverse an integer (e.g. 1234 to 4321).
#!/bin/bash

echo "enter the number"
read value 
reverse=0
remainder=0
while [ $value -ne 0 ];
do
      remainder=$(($value%10))
      reverse=$(($reverse*10+$(($remainder))))
      value=$(($value/10))
done
echo "reversed no is $reverse"

vidyas@vidyas:~/os$ bash ass3b.sh
enter the number
12345
reversed no is 54321
vidyas@vidyas:~/os$ bash ass3b.sh
enter the number
987654321
reversed no is 123456789

 Q.3 Create a looping menu to accept either (1) Simple interest or (2) Compound interest or (3) Exit as the option from the user. If the user selects Simple interest, accept principal amount (p), time (in years) (n) and rate of interest (r). Display simple interest using the formula interest = pnr / 100. If the user selected compound interest, also accept how many times interest was applied/calculated every year (t). Display compound interest using the formula interest = p x (1 + r/n) raised to the power (n x t)

#!/bin/bash


while [ 1 ]
do 
echo Enter Choice
echo 1. Simple Interest
echo 2. Compound Interest 
echo 0. Exit
read choice

if [ $choice -eq 1 ]
then
   echo "Enter the principal value:: "
   read p
   echo "Enter the rate of interest:: "
   read r 
   echo "Enter the Time period In Year:: "
   read t

    s=$(($p * $t * $r / 100))

   echo "Principal equal to ::"
   echo $s

elif [ $choice -eq 2 ]
then
   echo "Enter the principal value:: "
   read p
   echo "Enter the rate of interest:: "
   read r 
   echo "Enter the Time period In Year:: "
   read t
   echo "No of times CI calculated per Year::"
   read n

   power=$(($n * $t))

   ci=$( echo "scale=2; ( $p * ( ( 1 + ( $r / ( $n * 100 ) ) ) ^ $power )) - $p" | bc)

echo "Compound Interest "
echo $ci
else
break
